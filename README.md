# PHP image with Laravel

This repo is used to generate a base PHP image that includes Laravel, the well-known PHP framework
for web apps.  All the usual extensions are already built into the image, including support for mysql. `composer` is
also installed in the image to allow you to manage your packages within Docker.  Currently 
PHP version 7.3 is supported, but new versions will be added as they become stable.

Please check the PDT Wiki for instructions on how to create a Laravel microservice based on this image.
